# Lessons
This repository was created for me to upload my practical tasks from the lessons there.

This directory contains a directory :file_folder: <a href="https://github.com/OlehLy/Lessons-and-Practice/tree/main/Front-end/Lessons/Small-Simple-Projects/">Small-Simple-Projects</a> in which I publish simple projects that I created in order to practice my skills in creating websites
