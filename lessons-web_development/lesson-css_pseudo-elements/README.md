I took this layout from the YouTube channel "Freelancer life style".

He is a Ukrainian web programmer and blogger.

This layout I recreated was the homework of this Ukrainian blogger in one of his tutorials on the pseudo-elements in css files. (link to video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM_9k1eWiXA&list=PLM6XATa8CAG4F9nAIYNS5oAiPotxwLFIr&index=13)

I decided to practice my web development skills.
